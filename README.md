# Spring Boot Kafka Microservices

This project is a Spring Boot application that utilizes Apache Kafka for asynchronous messaging between services. The architecture consists of two microservices: **User Service** and **User Address Service**, which communicate through Kafka topics. Additionally, there is a **Notification Service** that listens for events and sends notifications accordingly.

## Architecture Overview

- **User Service**: Manages user-related operations and sends user events to Kafka topics.
- **User Address Service**: Consumes user events from Kafka topics to manage user addresses.
- **Notification Service**: Consumes events from Kafka topics to send notifications based on user actions.

Both the **User Address Service** and **Notification Service** listen to the same Kafka topic, allowing them to respond to user creation events in real-time.

## Features

- Event-driven architecture using Kafka for high-throughput data streams.
- Asynchronous communication between microservices.
- Real-time notifications for user-related events.

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot
- JDK 17
- Apache Kafka
- Spring Kafka
- Postgresql
- Couchbase
- Docker

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 17
- Gradle 
- Docker

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/nihadamirov/spring-boot-kafka>
   cd spring-kafka-microservices
   ```

2. **Run Docker containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Build the application**:

   Navigate to each microservice directory (`user-service`, `user-address-service`, and `notification-consumer`) and run:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

## Communication Flow

1. **User Service** publishes events to Kafka when user actions occur.
2. **User Address Service** consumes these events to manage user addresses accordingly.
3. **Notification Service** consumes events to send notifications to users.
4. Both **User Address Service** and **Notification Service** listen to the same Kafka topic, ensuring that both services can react to user creation events.
